  ### Display ###

  # Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
  #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
  #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
  #   none: don't follow anything
  #
  # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
  # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
  # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
  #
  # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
  # will be ignored.

  # Possible values are:

  #        <u>underline</u>
  #

  #
  # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
  #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the
  #        server. Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is
  #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
  #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
  #
  # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
  #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
  #        capability if this is set as a global setting.

  # It's important to note that markup inside the format option will be parsed
  # regardless of what this is set to.

  # Possible values are:
  # * none: Don't do anything.
  # * do_action: Invoke the action determined by the action_name rule. If there is no
  #              such action, open the context menu.
  # * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple
  #             ones, open the context menu.
  # * close_current: Close current notification.
  # * close_all: Close all notifications.
  # * context: Open context menu for the notification.
  # * context_all: Open context menu for all notifications.
  # These values can be strung together for each mouse event, and
  # will be executed in sequence.
